            <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <p>When Michela Ferrari moved to San Francisco, she didn't expect pottery to become such a big part
                    of her life. As a 27-year-old product designer at Comun, a financial technology company, she
                    spends most of her days in front of a screen. But in 2021, nearing the end of the COVID-19
                    pandemic, she decided to try something new. “I kind of wanted something to do other than working
                    from home,” she said. Her boyfriend at the time—now husband—encouraged her to give pottery a
                    try.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <p>“You’d really enjoy it,” he told her, drawing from his own experience with pottery in art school.
                    “He was like, you should try it out.”</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <p>For Ferrari, pottery became more than just a hobby; it became a third space. “Especially when I
                    was living close to my studio, it was so easy to go there and spend time... it gave me a sense
                    of ownership, like I belong here,” she said.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="4">
                <p>Third spaces are spaces outside of home and work where people gather and establish community.
                    They are particularly relevant for young tech workers in San Francisco, many of whom work
                    remotely and don’t have established communities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="5">
                <p>Tommy Li, a 26-year-old product designer at Atlassian, a collaboration-focused software company,
                    shares Ferrari’s sentiment. “Pottery feels like a third space for me,” he said. Like Ferrari, Li
                    spends most of his day in front of a screen—be it at the office or at home—and pottery offers a
                    break from the digital world.</p>

    <section class="content">
        <h2 class="subheader">Social Spaces</h2>
        <div class="two-track">
            <div class="text-track">
                <div class="step" data-step="1">
                    <p>Meg Frazier, a program manager at Adobe in her late 20s, agreed with Li’s sentiment. “Pottery
                        gets me
                        out of the house,” she said. “After college, I wasn’t hanging out in communal spaces with
                        friends as
                        often as I used to, and after COVID, the motivation for me to go out was even less.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="step" data-step="2">
                    <p>Though Frazier works in-person twice a week, a majority of her work is done online, like Li’s.
                        Hitting the bar with colleagues after work isn’t uncommon, but Frazier pointed out that pottery
                        is a
                        nice space to have as someone who doesn’t necessarily enjoy drinking all the time. She also
                        likes
                        having a space separate from her friend group and work life where she can meet people.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step" data-step="3">
                    <p>For some, pottery is a social activity, while for others, it’s a quiet retreat. Frazier has
                        noticed a
                        mix of both. “Some people come in with headphones and others want to make friends.” Michela, who
                        has
                        been taking classes for years, has built relationships with classmates and studio owners. She
                        initially started going with friends, but over time, they stopped coming while she kept going.
                        “But
                        it was nice because you would make friends in your classes,” she said. “(Even though) I wouldn't
                        consider them necessarily like my friends, it's people you know, they’ll ask you what you’re
                        working
                        on.” She also enjoys the variety of ages that appear in pottery studios. “There's a lot of older
                        people that are retired … And it's nice to have an older person to talk to, and sometimes
                        they'll
                        bring in their dogs,” Ferrari mentioned. </p>

                <div class="step" data-step="4">
                    <p>Some people bring friends with them, whether to share the experience or collaborate. Li once
                        invited
                        a friend who wasn’t a studio member to help him finish abandoned pieces. “I had a bunch of stuff
                        I
                        hadn't glazed, and I just had her paint on a piece I made and had no plans to finish. It's cool
                        to
                        have a collaboration opportunity and to be able to use that space to interact with people I
                        know,”
                        Li said.</p>

                    <p>While pottery offers a creative and social aspect, it can be costly. Li initially hesitated to
                        sign
                        up because of the price. “It’s not a cheap hobby,” he said. “But eventually I signed up, and
                        once I
                        started, I really enjoyed it. I’ve been doing pottery for about eight months now.”

                        He also acknowledges the exclusivity that comes with the expense. “The thing about it is that
                        it’s
                        an expensive hobby. People who can afford to have that kind of space—it feels kind of bad, you

                    <p> Ferrari also acknowledged that pottery is expensive, but has found workarounds to make it fit in
                        her
                        budget. “Typically for the three hour class, it’s $200. So I never tried that, because the six
                        week
                        class is $350 and I was like, I’m just going to fully commit and do the expensive one,” she
                        said. “I
                        just try to do it when I know I’m going to have dedicated time and be physically present.”

                <div class="step" data-step="1">
                    <p>For Ferrari, pottery stands out from her other hobbies, like rug-making and drawing, because of
                        its unique challenges and rewards. “A lot of other hobbies are easy to pick up, at least for me,
                        and once you get the hang of it, you might lose interest,” she said. “But pottery is a never
                        ending challenge. You can always do more stuff and expand.” </p>

                    <p>Li pairs pottery with volleyball. Seeing the two hobbies as complementary. When the interviewer
                        compared their childhood hobbies to having one active and one creative hobby, Li agreed. “It
                        kind of sounds similar to having pottery and volleyball,” he said. “Yeah definitely.” For Li,
                        having both creative and physical hobbies has helped him maintain a healthy work-life balance
                        and even increased his productivity at work. “Having multiple things I care about outside of
                        work has actually helped with my work ethic,” he explained. “Before I got really invested in
                        these hobbies, I’d just keep working past 5 p.m. without much progress. Now, I schedule and set
                        goals to finish on time so I can make it to the studio or volleyball. It’s made me more
                        productive during the workday and get more out of my literal nine-to-five.”
