        <div class="text-track-intro">
            <div class="step">
                <p>As a newcomer to San Francisco, 26-year-old Tommy Li didn’t anticipate falling in love with pottery.
                    A lot of his friends were doing it, but the high cost deterred him from signing up. “It’s not a
                    cheap hobby,” he said. “But eventually I signed up, and once I started, I really enjoyed it.” He’s
                    now been doing pottery for about eight months.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="step">
                <p>Like many young professionals living in the Bay Area, Li works in tech. As a product designer at
                    Atlassian, he spends most of his day in front of a screen — be it at the office or at home. “Pottery
                    feels like a third space for me,” he said.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="step">
                <p>Third spaces are places outside of home and work where people gather and establish community. They
                    are particularly relevant for young tech workers in San Francisco, many of whom work remotely and
                    don’t have established communities.</p>

                <p class="overlay-text">Meg Frazier, a program manager at Adobe in her late 20s, agreed with Li’s
                    sentiment. “Pottery
                    gets me out of the house,” she said. “After college, I wasn’t hanging out in communal spaces
                    with friends as often as I used to, and after COVID, the motivation for me to go out was even
                    less.”</p>

            <div class="image-overlay plate2">
                <img src="plate3.png" alt="green square plate" class="overlay-image plate2">
                <p class="overlay-text">Though Frazier works in-person twice a week, a majority of her work is done
                    online. Hitting the
                    bar with colleagues after work isn’t uncommon, but pottery is a nice space to have as someone
                    who doesn’t enjoy drinking all the time, Frazier said. She also enjoys having a friend group
                    separate from work.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-overlay plate3">

                <p class="overlay-text-2">Michela Ferrari, a mid-20s product designer at Comun, also started pottery after
                    the pandemic.
                    With classes running for six weeks at a time, Ferrari quickly formed friendships with regulars,
                    including classmates and studio owners. Though most friendships have remained in-studio, she
                    enjoys having pottery as her third space.</p>

        <h2 class="subheader">POTTERY IS TACTILE</h2>
        <div class="text-tact">
            <div class="step">
                <p>Ferrari appreciates how working with her hands is a more physical and unstructured form of creativity compared to her digital design work. “There’s something very primitive about having clay in your hands,” she said. “It’s a nice sensation to have something physically bonding.”</p>
            </div>
   
            <div class="step">
                <p>Similarly, Li described pottery as a refreshing change from Zoom meetings all day. “It’s a hands-on, time-sensitive activity that requires focus and a different kind of problem-solving mindset,” he said. Li likened it to the extracurricular activities he used to do as a kid: a way to unplug and destress.</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Li, Frazier and Ferrari all shared an appreciation for the physicality of pottery. “It’s truly a
                        process,” Frazier said. “Pottery takes time and commitment, but that’s what makes it so
                        satisfying when you finish a project.”</p>

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Both Li and Ferrari described how they’ve integrated pottery into their everyday lives. Li uses a
                        large bowl of his own making to hold his Lactaid pills, which he takes on a daily basis. Ferrari
                        also enjoys making functional tableware — including a cup with a corgi design inside that
                        becomes visible when drinking. </p>

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Community is another crucial aspect of why pottery is so rewarding. Li, Frazier and Ferrari
                        signed up for classes in their residential areas out of convenience. “I often run into people
                        from the studio at local cafes or parks,” Li said. “It wasn’t intentional, but pottery has
                        definitely increased my sense of community in the area.”

                <div class="step">
                    <p>Beyond finding community and producing beautiful designs, Ferrari comes back to the personal
                        fulfillment of making with her hands. “It’s more challenging and requires more patience than
                        drawing or rug making,” she said. “Pottery is a never-ending challenge, and you can always do
                        more stuff and expand.”
