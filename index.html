        <h2 class="subtitle">How Pottery is Captivating San Francisco's Young Tech Workers</h2>

        <div class="text-track">
            <div class="step" data-step="1">
                <p>As a newcomer to San Francisco, 26-year-old Tommy Li didn’t anticipate falling in love with pottery. A lot of his friends were doing it, but the high cost deterred him from signing up. “It’s not a cheap hobby,” he said. “But eventually I signed up, and once I started, I really enjoyed it.” He’s now been doing pottery for about eight months.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="2">
                <p>Like many young professionals living in the Bay Area, Li works in tech. As a product designer at Atlassian, he spends most of his day in front of a screen — be it at the office or at home. “Pottery feels like a third space for me,” he said.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="3">
                <p>Third spaces are places outside of home and work where people gather and establish community. They are particularly relevant for young tech workers in San Francisco, many of whom work remotely and don’t have established communities.</p>

                    They are particularly relevant for young tech workers in San Francisco, many of whom work
                    remotely and don’t have established communities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step" data-step="5">
                <p>Tommy Li, a 26-year-old product designer at Atlassian, a collaboration-focused software company,
                    shares Ferrari’s sentiment. “Pottery feels like a third space for me,” he said. Like Ferrari, Li
                    spends most of his day in front of a screen—be it at the office or at home—and pottery offers a
                    break from the digital world.</p>

            <div class="text-track">
                <div class="step" data-step="1">
                    <p>Meg Frazier, a program manager at Adobe in her late 20s, agreed with Li’s sentiment. “Pottery gets me out of the house,” she said. “After college, I wasn’t hanging out in communal spaces with friends as often as I used to, and after COVID, the motivation for me to go out was even less.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="step" data-step="2">
                    <p>Though Frazier works in-person twice a week, a majority of her work is done online. Hitting the bar with colleagues after work isn’t uncommon, but pottery is a nice space to have as someone who doesn’t enjoy drinking all the time, Frazier said. She also enjoys having a friend group separate from work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="step" data-step="3">
                    <p>Michela Ferrari, a mid-20s product designer at Comun, also started pottery after the pandemic. With classes running for six weeks at a time, Ferrari quickly formed friendships with regulars, including classmates and studio owners. Though most friendships have remained in-studio, she enjoys having pottery as her third space.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- <div class="step" data-step="4">
                    <p>Some people bring friends with them, whether to share the experience or collaborate. Li once
                        invited a friend who wasn’t a studio member to help him finish abandoned pieces. “I had a bunch of stuff
                        I hadn't glazed, and I just had her paint on a piece I made and had no plans to finish. It's cool
                        to have a collaboration opportunity and to be able to use that space to interact with people I know,” Li said.</p>

                <p class="overlay-text">Ferrari appreciates how working with her hands is a more physical and unstructured form of creativity compared to her digital design work. “There’s something very primitive about having clay in your hands,” she said. “It’s a nice sensation to have something physically bonding.”

                <p class="overlay-text">Similarly, Li described pottery as a refreshing change from Zoom meetings all day. “It’s a hands-on, time-sensitive activity that requires focus and a different kind of problem-solving mindset,” he said. Li likened it to the extracurricular activities he used to do as a kid: a way to unplug and destress.</p>

                    studios closer to their respective neighborhoods, Marina and Duboce. One of Stone Gold’s policies is
                    “no phones.”
                    <br><br>
                    When asked about this policy, Li pointed out that even if he had access to a phone, “it’s literally
                    impossible to be checking Slack while throwing on the wheel.”

                    <p>With one-time classes around $120 per person and class packages anywhere from $250 to $900, pottery isn’t cheap — even for young professionals making six figures in tech. Especially for those nervous to learn a new skill, pottery has high barriers to entry.

                    <p>Jenna, a 23-year-old associate product manager at Hubspot, pays $100 per month for her gym membership — something she considers an investment in her mental and physical health. “Pottery is super cool, but I’d rather save up to travel and eat out,” she said. Jenna pointed out that working out, like pottery, can be social and personally rewarding.

                    <p> Li participates in intramural volleyball in his free time, but still invests in pottery as something he specifically finds creatively stimulating. “I enjoy its relaxed pace,” he said. “But overall, I’d say having both creative and physical hobbies has helped me maintain a healthy work-life balance and increased my productivity at work.”

                <p>Despite pottery being expensive, Frazier likes how membership at her pottery studio gives her access to a reliably warm, feminine space.

                    <p>For Ferrari, pottery stands out from her other hobbies, like rug-making and drawing, because of
                        its unique challenges and rewards. “A lot of other hobbies are easy to pick up, at least for me,
                        and once you get the hang of it, you might lose interest,” she said. “But pottery is a never
                        ending challenge. You can always do more stuff and expand.”</p>

                <div class="step" data-step="2">
                    <p>Li pairs pottery with volleyball, seeing the two hobbies as complementary. When the interviewer
                        compared their childhood hobbies to having one active and one creative hobby, Li agreed. “It
                        kind of sounds similar to having pottery and volleyball,” he said. “Yeah definitely.” For Li,
                        having both creative and physical hobbies has helped him maintain a healthy work-life balance
                        and even increased his productivity at work. “Having multiple things I care about outside of
                        work has actually helped with my work ethic,” he explained. “Before I got really invested in
                        these hobbies, I’d just keep working past 5 p.m. without much progress. Now, I schedule and set
                        goals to finish on time so I can make it to the studio or volleyball. It’s made me more
                        productive during the workday and get more out of my literal nine-to-five.”

                    <p>Community is another crucial aspect of why pottery is so rewarding.
